Your answers should be specific to the code that you are writing, so please avoid generic answers. For example, if asked, \"What do you plan to do?\", please avoid simply answering, \"I will test the code.\" Instead explain how you will test the code and why (e.g. \"I will now test the edge case of an empty list, which should return...\")."
